"><p>once upon a time<br>
There was a boy<br>
I was born with wings<br>
Its wings are weak<br>
It was different from what humans had.</p>
<p>But he saw a bird flying in the sky<br>
I wished I could fly in the sky<br>
I wanted to see the world for once.</p>
<p>The wings are still weak<br>
I couldn&rsquo;t make the boy fly.<br>
but<br>
He has an indomitable spirit<br>
I didn&rsquo;t give up on my dream</p>
<p>So he came up with a plan. <br>
Travel to the capitals of distant countries <br>
I bought a sandbag</p>
<p>The sandbag <br>
It was used in the great temples of the Western Regions. <br>
It was said to have the power to seal away the Demon King.<br>
The sandbag gets bigger as you use it.<br>
It&rsquo;s getting heavier</p>
<p>he<br>
Watching people running<br>
I often found myself carrying a punching bag on my back.<br>
However, the punching bags are usually not very large.<br>
They are primarily using it to build leg strength.</p>
<p>So he thought<br>
If he wants to improve his wing power<br>
You won&rsquo;t achieve your goals with a regular punching bag.<br>
Because it&rsquo;s too light<br>
And as his own power grows<br>
If the weight of the punching bag does not change<br>
You can&rsquo;t be stronger</p>
<p>To make his wings strong enough to fly<br>
I decided to carry a punching bag that sealed the power of the Demon King.<br>
He is day and night<br>
I practiced beating my wings continuously. <br>
When his power doubles<br>
The weight of the bag will also double. <br>
He borrowed the power of the Demon King<br>
I continued my training.</p>
<p>His wings grow bigger<br>
One day he spread his wings and<br>
It is higher than the roof<br>
It was bigger than the garden.<br>
And he decided to give it a try.<br>
To see if I can fly</p>
<p>He came to the great plain<br>
Test flights are conducted here<br>
He flapped his wings<br>
I tried to fly with all my might<br>
Even if it&rsquo;s just a millimeter<br>
But he couldn&rsquo;t fly<br>
He tried again and again<br>
But he still couldn&rsquo;t fly<br>
And he almost lost hope</p>
<p>At that time,<br>
A girl passed by him <br>
The girl said<br>
&ldquo;Wow, your wings are so pretty!<br>
I&rsquo;ve never seen such beautiful wings before.<br>
And it grows on a human body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the girl said again <br>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s weird.<br>
Why are you carrying such a big bag of sand when you&rsquo;re trying to fly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the boy realized<br>
In fact, he has been training with sandbags on his back for many years.  <br>
What you really need when flying<br>
It was because he had forgotten that he was carrying a sandbag.</p>
<p>The girl said mischievously. <br>
&ldquo;Look!<br>
If I hadn&rsquo;t made them realize it,<br>
When will I be able to fly?<br>
Hahaha<br>
So how are you going to thank us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy had never seen such a beautiful and kind girl.<br>
He blushed.<br>
I was so embarrassed that I couldn&rsquo;t speak at all.</p>
<p>The girl said again<br>
&ldquo;Well, promise me.
When you try flying, try holding me and flying
How is it?」<br>
&ldquo;I want to know what it feels like to see the world from the sky.&rdquo;<br>
The boy replied<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not difficult,<br>
But this is my first test flight.<br>
I don&rsquo;t have enough confidence<br>
That could be quite dangerous<br>
Are you sure?」</p>
<p>Then the girl smiled and said<br>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to fly, I&rsquo;ll follow you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with the help of the girl<br>
The boy removed the sandbag.<br>
And hold the girl<br>
Slowly at first<br>
Gradually accelerate<br>
He flapped his wings<br>
To my surprise, in no time<br>
They flew into the clouds<br>
There is a palace in the clouds,<br>
There were many beautiful flowers blooming there.<br>
Neither of us had ever experienced such a sight.</p>
<p>The two of them gazed upon the white rubber flowers.<br>
I smelled that scent<br>
This scent is unlike anything I&rsquo;ve ever experienced on earth.<br>
It was very light and attractive.<br>
And they sat down on the ground and cried together</p>
<p>Go ahead<br>
Inside the palace<br>
The Buddha Koseki is preaching the Dharma<br>
Bodhisattvas and Arahants of each path stand on either side<br>
Just the Buddha points to the flowers<br>
Birch petals fall like a heavy rain<br>
Raining from the sky<br>
Falling to the ground in the clouds<br>
The ground becomes like a sea of ​​petals<br>
I can&rsquo;t tell the difference between clouds and flowers</p>
<p>At that time<br>
Those present only smell a faint scent.<br>
However, the scent is the same as that of a single birch flower.</p>
<p>Manjusri asks the Buddha<br>
There are so many flowers<br>
Why doesn&rsquo;t the scent get stronger?</p>
<p>Only Koseki Nyorai is seated on the treasured throne of Leo.<br>
With unsurpassed splendor and unparalleled majesty<br>
A golden light radiates from the whole body.<br>
Illuminating the Sea of ​​Flowers<br>
The clouds instantly turn into a golden sea<br>
When the people on land look up<br>
All I can see is a golden sky<br>
I can&rsquo;t find the position of the sun<br>
A golden mist hangs over the land of Shinshu.<br>
Where the fog reaches<br>
Flowers bloom all at once<br>
The wilted leaves become green again<br>
All the plants rustle with a golden mist<br>
Forming a rhythm<br>
Thirty-two melodies are born<br>
Temporary<br>
All the instruments in the world<br>
To hear nature&rsquo;s amazing symphonies<br>
Keep quiet<br>
All humans, all animals, all life<br>
Worship Together<br>
Praise this magnificent sight</p>
<p>A divine beast lies prostrate next to the Koseki Buddha.<br>
His Buddhist name is Koukou.<br>
Xiang&rsquo;s whole body is covered with snow-white fur.<br>
If you look closely, you can see that each individual hair emits a silvery white light.<br>
It is faintly visible, sometimes it is there, sometimes it is not.<br>
He possesses infinite purity.<br>
With the utmost solemnity<br>
Possesses infinite wisdom<br>
The bodhisattvas and arhats who saw his light<br>
Instantly acquire pure eyes<br>
Observe everything<br>
It is said that it can break evil and show you the truth.<br>
That&rsquo;s called pure eye.</p>
<p>The Buddha of Incense answers:<br>
&ldquo;All these flowers<br>
A pure and spotless flower<br>
From petals to the center<br>
No greed whatsoever<br>
Therefore<br>
They suppress their own scent<br>
It gives its scent to other flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time<br>
The Great Bodhisattva stepped forward<br>
Put your hands together<br>
Ask the Buddha<br>
&ldquo;In that case<br>
Why is it just a single flower here?<br>
Can you detect a faint scent?</p>
<p>At that time<br>
In the middle of the sea of ​​flowers, a single flower shook gently.<br>
The other flowers are completely still.<br>
When everyone turns their gaze<br>
There was a big red thorn flower there.<br>
To make sure<br>
Everyone approached each other.<br>
I sniffed the scent<br>
After confirming that it is this flower that is giving off the scent<br>
She floats up into the air<br>
Made it so everyone can see<br>
and<br>
She began to emit an ever-increasing floral scent.<br>
immediately<br>
102 angels smell this fragrance<br>
She had a charming smile<br>
The more than 100,000 Arahants present<br>
As soon as I smell this fragrance<br>
I have attained the bodhi mind that will never turn back.</p>
<p>At this time<br>
The Buddha speaks to everyone<br>
&ldquo;actually<br>
All the flowers have lost their scent<br>
Only one flower emits a fragrance<br>
Not only did she refuse to smell the flowers,<br>
He rejected the commandment itself.<br>
Therefore<br>
Her scent is selfless<br>
Big or small<br>
Thick or thin<br>
Completely natural<br>
This scent is a scent<br>
It is fragrance-free.<br>
It is Hannya.<br>
It is meditation.<br>
It is a great cleansing<br>
Great freedom.<br>
This is the highest level of enlightenment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy and girl sitting at the far end of the main hall<br>
Listening to the Buddha&rsquo;s teachings<br>
At that time<br>
The boy asks the girl<br>
&ldquo;We have not yet seen the world from the air.<br>
Should I go and see it now?”</p>
<p>but,<br>
The girl takes the boy&rsquo;s hand<br>
I say<br>
&ldquo;This is a really beautiful place.<br>
We&rsquo;re going to live here from now on.<br>
Forget the dreams of the past,<br>
I will never see the world again.<br>
What do you think?”</p>
<p>The boy is silent<br>
They sat on the ground and cried.<br>
Since then<br>
When they sit on the ground it rains<br>
Now the sun comes out when I feel cold<br>
They never wanted to see the world again<br>
I forgot about the wings and the sandbags.<br>
They then<br>
I lived a life like a hermit.</p>
