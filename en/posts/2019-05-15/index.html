"><p>If there is a way to be indifferent to all things, then that method requires that one be indifferent to &ldquo;indifference&rdquo; itself. In other words, indifference that &ldquo;allows indifference,&rdquo; this is called the &ldquo;Law of Great Indifference&rdquo; or &ldquo;Great Forbearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In contrast, the method of not allowing oneself to be shaken under any circumstances is called the &ldquo;method of small indifference&rdquo; or &ldquo;small patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking an object as an example, in the first stage you can only be moved by that object. In the second stage you are able to remain indifferent to that object. In the third stage you are not only able to remain indifferent to that object, but also to &ldquo;indifference&rdquo; itself.</p>
<p>If you have reached this stage, you have perfected great indifference toward one thing. Then, by extending this method to all things in the world, you will be able to cut off karmic obstacles and there will be no things that you cannot tolerate. This can be called &ldquo;the method of great indifference&rdquo; or &ldquo;great tolerance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you ask someone how to express &ldquo;emptiness,&rdquo; he might answer, &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo; Or, you might show him a piece of white paper and say, &ldquo;This is emptiness.&rdquo; But he&rsquo;s wrong. Because if there is such a state as &ldquo;nothing,&rdquo; that state itself would exist, and it would not truly be &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo; Also, white paper is not truly colorless, because white color exists.</p>
<p>This is like asking a painter how to paint &ldquo;transparency.&rdquo; The painter would be stumped, because transparency cannot be painted or not painted. Transparency is complete emptiness, and not only is it colorless, but the concept of &ldquo;absence of color&rdquo; (white) does not even exist.</p>
<p>What is the color of pure water? Perhaps the only answer is: It is the color you see. This quality is called &ldquo;transparency.&rdquo; Therefore, the nature of the Buddha is also transparent. If you want to prove the existence of the Buddha, start by &ldquo;proving the existence of transparency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Method 1: Fill a pure white bathtub with clear water, then drop a drop of ink into it. You will see that the white of the water gradually turns black, and you will see that the water itself is transparent.</p>
<p>Second method: If you stand in front of a white wall and cover your eyes with a black cloth, then suddenly remove the cloth, you will see the white wall. At this time, you will realize that air is transparent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something coming from nothing&rdquo; and &ldquo;something coming from nothing&rdquo; are two ways of proving the existence of transparency.</p>
<p>A further question on this topic is how to express &ldquo;complete inaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you ask someone &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; and they answer &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing anything,&rdquo; they are actually doing the act of &ldquo;not doing anything.&rdquo; For this reason, the &ldquo;state of doing absolutely nothing&rdquo; cannot be expressed in the usual way. This is because maintaining the state of &ldquo;not doing anything&rdquo; is itself an act, even if you are not doing anything.</p>
<p>We think of what we can see and hear as the &ldquo;world&rdquo; itself, and that we live in that &ldquo;world.&rdquo; Therefore, when we hear silence, we unconsciously think, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear anything,&rdquo; but this is a complete reversal. The reason this is reversed is because we think of everything we can see and hear (the so-called &ldquo;world&rdquo;) as existing prior to &ldquo;ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in materialism, the definition of &ldquo;the world&rdquo; or &ldquo;the universe&rdquo; is everything that exists prior to the observer, including the observer himself. This is the core idea of ​​materialism: materialism assumes that the existence of the world is independent of the observer (although in reality it is).</p>
<p>The assumption that the &ldquo;universe&rdquo; exists before observation is the essence of materialism, and is a major flaw in the theory. Due to this flaw, materialism cannot essentially explain the fundamental laws of physics, and can only set them as &ldquo;axioms&rdquo;. For example, it cannot explain why the speed of light is constant, no matter what the reference frame of observation. However, if we go beyond materialism, this is very simple: because this world is originally &ldquo;obtained by measurement&rdquo;, and there are only things that exist within the range of measurement.</p>
<p>Idealism holds that we exist prior to the world and claims that &ldquo;I think, therefore I exist.&rdquo; If so, who defines the existence of &ldquo;I&rdquo; before the world exists? Only yourself. So how can you define your own limitations? If there is no external world, your limitations can be big or small. &ldquo;I&rdquo; would cease to exist, because you cannot define your own limitations.</p>
<p>In the end, linking &ldquo;whether you see it or not&rdquo; with &ldquo;whether it exists or not&rdquo; is limited to materialist or idealist settings. In the materialist natural science system, all things exist before the observer, and &ldquo;whether it exists or not&rdquo; comes first, and &ldquo;whether you see it or not&rdquo; comes later. If it does not exist, it is impossible to &ldquo;see&rdquo; it in nature. Materialism believes that the world exists before us. Let&rsquo;s criticize this with the example of the moon. If someone claims that the moon exists and has not observed the existence of the moon in advance, is that possible? If this is true, anyone can say &ldquo;the moon,&rdquo; and it would exist in a universe with &ldquo;no observers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there is an &ldquo;A&rdquo;  <br>
&ldquo;Not yet -A&rdquo; will be displayed<br>
And there must be &ldquo;B&rdquo; observing &ldquo;A&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Not yet -B&rdquo; will be displayed<br>
Then you will see &ldquo;C&rdquo; observing &ldquo;B&rdquo;</p>
<p>When &ldquo;C&rdquo; is &ldquo;A&rdquo;<br>
Then &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; observe each other<br>
&ldquo;B&rdquo; must belong to &ldquo;Not-A&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;A&rdquo; must belong to &ldquo;Not-B&rdquo;</p>
<p>In summary<br>
If there is no &ldquo;A&rdquo;,<br>
And there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;Not-A&rdquo;<br>
And there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;B&rdquo;<br>
And there is no &ldquo;Un-B&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, launch:<br>
If there is &ldquo;A&rdquo;, there is &ldquo;B&rdquo;<br>
If &ldquo;A&rdquo; does not exist, then there is no &ldquo;B&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, outside of materialism, existence is not absolute, but relative to a particular observer. For example, if I say, &ldquo;I am looking at a table,&rdquo; this table &ldquo;exists&rdquo; to &ldquo;me,&rdquo; but I am not guaranteed that it &ldquo;exists&rdquo; to any other observer. In essence, when you are looking at a table, it is inaccurate to think that the table exists prior to your observation. The only way to use the concept of &ldquo;existence&rdquo; is to say, &ldquo;I am looking at a table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When existence becomes relative, the possibility arises that &ldquo;all things do not exist.&rdquo; We see a world, but this world exists only relative to the observer. Therefore, in essence, it is possible for both us and the world to not exist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All things do not exist&rdquo; is a mistake if taken literally. If the &ldquo;existence&rdquo; gained through observation is called &ldquo;form,&rdquo; then true and complete emptiness is called &ldquo;emptiness.&rdquo; Everything observed arises from a vacuum. On the other hand, &ldquo;emptiness&rdquo; cannot be sensed, because it cannot be sensed unless one observes &ldquo;form.&rdquo; This is the interpretation of &ldquo;form is emptiness, emptiness is form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use &ldquo;color&rdquo; and &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; to interpret this sentence. It may be easier to understand if we call &ldquo;color&rdquo; &ldquo;color&rdquo; and &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; &ldquo;emptiness.&rdquo; First, the question is: how do we perceive transparency? It is impossible to see transparency directly; anything we see has color. This is &ldquo;emptiness is color.&rdquo; Conversely, any color we see arises from transparency. This is &ldquo;form is emptiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the double slit experiment with electrons, the electrons seem to sense our act of observation. We observe that the interference fringes are different when &ldquo;people observe&rdquo; and when &ldquo;people do not observe&rdquo;. This cannot be understood by materialistic natural science. Materialism assumes that &ldquo;electrons&rdquo; exist from the beginning, but this assumption itself is incorrect. This is because it is impossible to know that &ldquo;electrons have been emitted&rdquo; without observation. &ldquo;Electrons&rdquo; &ldquo;exist&rdquo; because observation is necessary, which naturally explains why the interference fringes are different when &ldquo;people observe&rdquo; and when &ldquo;people do not observe&rdquo;. This can be understood as follows: The interference fringes when &ldquo;people do not observe&rdquo; are the result of &ldquo;observation of the paper board&rdquo;, and the interference fringes when &ldquo;people observe&rdquo; are the result of the superposition of &ldquo;human observation&rdquo; and &ldquo;observation of the paper board&rdquo;. If we are to think about why &ldquo;electrons&rdquo; exist if &ldquo;no one observes them,&rdquo; the materialistic worldview brings up the &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo; of quantum physics, but in reality, &ldquo;quantum&rdquo; only &ldquo;exists&rdquo; &ldquo;after observation,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;before observation&rdquo; state is essentially a &ldquo;wave,&rdquo; with natural &ldquo;uncertainty.&rdquo; However, materialism treats &ldquo;waves&rdquo; as real &ldquo;entities&rdquo; and recognizes &ldquo;wave-particle duality.&rdquo; This means that the &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo; of &ldquo;after observation&rdquo; in materialism is artificially set.</p>
<p>The observer and the world prove each other&rsquo;s existence. If they were separated from each other, neither would exist. This is because the observer and the world have the same origin and arise from a vacuum. This vacuum is total emptiness, in which absolutely nothing exists. Realizing this emptiness is seeing the truth of the world. In a state of total emptiness, in which there is absolutely nothing, &ldquo;emptiness&rdquo; itself does not exist. Therefore, total emptiness cannot be expressed. If there is an expression, it is not total emptiness. Therefore, this is something to be realized, but not proven.</p>
<p>Just as white is not transparent, white can forget that it is transparent, but this happens in transparency. There is no way to see how to find transparency, because everything you can see has color. But there is no way to see transparency, because there is always a transparency between the color you see and your eye. If it were not so, the color you see would be a different color. There is always a transparency between your eye and an object of another color. If it were not so, you would have to repeat the same process until transparency is proven.</p>
